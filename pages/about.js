      <h3>Welcome to my 'About me' page!</h3>
      <p>
        I am thrilled to have you here as I embark on my journey as a
        first-generation Latina in the tech field. My goal here is not just talk
        about my personal aspirations and achievements; it is about finding ways
        of breaking barriers and paving the way for underrepresented individuals
        of color who dream of entering the world of technology. I believe that
        by sharing my experiences, challenges, and triumphs, I can inspire
        others to take the courageous steps necessary to create a better life
        for themselves and their families while making a lasting impact on the
        tech industry. Join me as we shatter stereotypes, challenge norms, and
        build a more inclusive and diverse tech community together.
